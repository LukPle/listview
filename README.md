# Android App Library: ListView

## About
Welcome to our Android application. The app is part of the Open Sorce [Android App Library](https://github.com/LukPle/android-app-library.git) 
and adopts all licensing and community guidelines from this project. Please use the link in order to check out the corresponding repository.

The listview app showcases the **ListView** with elements of an **ArrayList** by arranging them in different views below each other via an **Adapter**. 
The application serves as an example of these features.
This method of creating lists in Android is easy to use but also deprecated.
A more modern way for creating lists is the [RecyclerView](https://github.com/LukPle/recyclerview-adapter.git).

## Features
The setting for this example is a collection of movies. An ArrayList contains different movies with their name, realease date and a suitable image.
The user can scroll trough the list displayed on the screen.

## Usage
You can clone the repository into Android Studio by clicking "Get from VCS" in the Welcome Screen or navigating to "File - New - Project from Version Control" inside 
the IDE. When doing so use the URL provided by GitHub. You can run the app on your mobile device or an emulator. Feel free to modify the code or utilize this sample 
for your own project.
